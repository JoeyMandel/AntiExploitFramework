# Anti-Exploit Framework
***
## Introduction:
On Roblox we have no shortage of anticheats to choose from. Dozens of anticheats varying from very good to completely useless. However I've noticed that the vast majority of these do not address a key issue that is inherent in games. That problem is that every game is unique so it is impossible for your anticheat to account for every situation. 

Consider a game where players can interact with vehicles and we introduce a general anticheat. This anticheat might eliminate exploits with basic player movement however it completely breaks your vehicle system, constantly falsely flagging players driving and incorrectly punishing them.

This is of no fault of the developer of the anticheat however it would be better if these anticheats would make it easier to modify their scripts.

## So what is this project?
The goal of this project is to create an anticheat that is focussed on making it simple, and easy to fit this module into your game's needs while also providing good protection by default.

So far this module helps protect against noclipping, speed and fly exploits while also making it simple to refit existing checks and add more checks. The API also encourages you to connect other scripts to this module (an idea is using the flag system and connecting it to another script to notify moderators of a potential exploiter)
