# Anti-Exploit Framework
***
## Introduction:
On Roblox we have no shortage of anticheats to choose from. There are well over a dozen anticheats are free and widely availible. However the majority of these projects have a critical flaw. They are too hard to edit.

Consider a game where players can interact with vehicles and we introduce a general anticheat. This anticheat might eliminate exploits with basic player movement however it completely breaks with your vehicle system, incorrectly punishing innocent players.

You want to fix it but once you see the 1500 lines of compact, high-octane,

## So what is this project?
The goal of this project is to create an anticheat that is focussed on developer accessibility and ease of editing while also providing good protection by default.

This module helps protect against noclipping, speed and fly exploits while also making it simple to refit existing checks and add more checks. The API also encourages you to connect other scripts to this module (an idea is using the flag system and connecting it to another script to notify moderators of a potential exploiter)
